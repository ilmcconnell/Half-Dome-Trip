## Gear List
* Footwear
 * Bring well broken-in boots with good ankle support and good traction. Some of the most common injuries Half Dome hikers suffer are blisters and ankle injuries; good footwear is the best way to prevent these problems.

* Gloves
 * Many people find gloves helpful on the cables. However, if you bring your gloves up, pack them out. Hundreds of pounds of rotting gloves otherwise accumulate.

* Water

  * 1 gallon (4 liters) if hiking to the top of Half Dome
  * 2 quarts (2 liters) if hiking only to the top of Nevada Fall
  * 1 quart (1 liter) if hiking only to the top of Vernal Fall
